## Introduction

Brief about the project, its motivations, and objectives.
 
### High-Fidelity Design & Prototyping
 
 - Initial designs began with low-fidelity wireframes outlining the basic user journey. 
- Post feedback, transitioned to high-fidelity designs using Figma, emphasizing a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Color palette geared towards instilling trust and typography chosen for optimal readability.
- [View the mockups here](link-to-your-mockups).



## Challenges
- **Recommendation Engine**: With numerous algorithms at disposal, ensuring recommendations were both accurate and relevant was challenging. Eventually, a hybrid model combining collaborative and content-based filtering was adopted.
  
- **Scalability**: Ensuring the platform's scalability, especially with a large influx of products and users. Cloud-based solutions and database query optimizations were vital.

- One significant challenge was deciding on the best approach for the recommendation engine. With multiple algorithms available, I wanted to ensure that the recommendations were accurate and relevant. After researching and testing, I settled on a hybrid model combining collaborative and content-based filtering. This provided a balance between user behavior and product attributes, ensuring relevancy in recommendations.

- Another challenge was ensuring the platform was scalable, especially when handling a large volume of products and users. Leveraging cloud-based solutions and optimizing database queries proved instrumental in addressing this.

## Feedback & Iterations & Testimonials:

 
- Currently in beta, with a few vendors onboarded. Initial feedback is positive, with continuous iterations based on feedback.
- **Future Considerations**: A robust analytics dashboard for vendors and AR integration for a virtual "try-before-you-buy" experience.



## Tools Used
- **Design**: Figma for designs and prototyping.
- **Frontend**: React.js with Redux. Material-UI for styling.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js and GraphQL.
- **Database**: MongoDB.
- **Deployment**: Docker and AWS.
