## Introduction

Brief about the project, its motivations, and objectives.
 
### High-Fidelity Design & Prototyping
 
 - Initial designs began with low-fidelity wireframes outlining the basic user journey. 
- Post feedback, transitioned to high-fidelity designs using Figma, emphasizing a clean, modern aesthetic.
- Color palette geared towards instilling trust and typography chosen for optimal readability.

## Challenges

- One significant challenge was deciding on the best approach for the recommendation engine. With multiple algorithms available, I wanted to ensure that the recommendations were accurate and relevant. After researching and testing, I settled on a hybrid model combining collaborative and content-based filtering. This provided a balance between user behavior and product attributes, ensuring relevancy in recommendations.

- Another challenge was ensuring the platform was scalable, especially when handling a large volume of products and users. Leveraging cloud-based solutions and optimizing database queries proved instrumental in addressing this.

## Feedback & Iterations & Testimonials:

 
- The platform is currently in its beta stage, with a few pilot vendors onboarded. Initial feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and I'm continuously iterating based on user feedback. Future work involves integrating a more robust analytics dashboard for vendors and exploring integration with AR for a virtual "try-before-you-buy" experience.


## Tools Used

- Figma / Adobe XD 
- Frontend: React.js with Redux for state management. Leveraged Material-UI for component styling.

- Backend: Node.js with Express.js for creating a scalable and efficient server. Integrated GraphQL for flexible data querying.

- Database: MongoDB for its flexibility in storing product data and user profiles.

- Design: Figma for high-fidelity designs and prototyping.

- Deployment: Docker for containerization, and AWS for cloud-based deployment and scalability.
